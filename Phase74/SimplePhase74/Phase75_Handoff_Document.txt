                   PHASE 75 HANDOFF DOCUMENT
              External Verification (Non-Founder)
                  Execution Status: ACTIVE
                  Start Time: $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm')
===============================================================

📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Phase 75 execution has been successfully initiated. You are now in a
2-week verification window where independent reviewers will assess
system interpretability without founder guidance.

✅ COMPLETED
• Phase 75.1: Reviewer Selection Protocol ✓
  - reviewer_profiles.json generated with 3 reviewer types
  - Technical skeptic, domain practitioner, critical non-technical

• Phase 75 Execution Framework ✓
  - All scripts and templates created
  - Step-by-step guidance implemented
  - Status tracking established

🔄 IN PROGRESS
• Step 2: Reviewer Selection (Manual, 2-3 days)
  - Select actual people matching reviewer_profiles.json
  - Critical: NO system explanations given

⏳ UPCOMING (Next 2 Weeks)
• Step 3: Distribution of Phase 74 artifacts
• Step 4: 3-7 day independent review window
• Step 5: Response collection
• Step 6: Automated analysis (misalignment + trust scoring)
• Step 7: Phase 75 verdict (PASS/FAIL)

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA (To be measured)
The following must ALL be true for Phase 75 to PASS:

1. NO 🔴 classifications
   - No reviewer attributes false intelligence or bias

2. ≥70% 🟢 across reviewers  
   - Majority correctly understand system intent

3. Trust-after ≥ Trust-before for ALL reviewers
   - No reviewer loses trust after explanation

4. Gold phrase present (at least one reviewer):
   "I disagree with the result, but I trust the system."

🔒 HARD CONSTRAINTS (STILL ACTIVE)
Throughout Phase 75 execution, these constraints remain LOCKED:

❌ NO ranking changes to system
❌ NO weight changes to system  
❌ NO language changes to explanations
❌ NO UI polish or improvements
❌ NO learning loops activated
❌ NO persuasion during review sessions

Phase 75 is MEASUREMENT ONLY. No system changes allowed.

🚀 WHAT UNLOCKS AFTER PHASE 75 SUCCESS
If Phase 75 PASSES, you gain access to:

• Phase 76: Steel Team Confirmation
  Hostile expert review to stress-test explanations

• Phase 77: Minimal UI Exposure  
  First non-expert interface (minimal polish)

• Phase 78: Pilot Users
  Controlled real-world usage with monitoring

• Phase 79: Traction Experiments
  Systematic growth and retention testing

• Phase 80+: Valuation Reality
  External validation of business metrics

⚠️ IF PHASE 75 FAILS
This is NOT catastrophic. It means:

• Language leakage exists (fixable)
• Hidden assumptions revealed (valuable)
• Explanation contract incomplete (actionable)

Critical: Engine remains untouched. Determinism intact.
Failure at Phase 75 saves years of wrong assumptions.

📞 EXECUTION PROTOCOL DURING REVIEW WINDOW
For the next 3-7 days (independent review period):

SILENCE PROTOCOL:
• DO NOT contact reviewers
• DO NOT answer clarification questions
• DO NOT check on progress
• DO NOT modify any materials

If a reviewer contacts you:
Standard response: "Please document your confusion in the response form."

Confusion = Valid data
Silence = Protocol

📁 FILES CREATED & THEIR PURPOSE
1. reviewer_profiles.json
   - Template for reviewer selection
   - DO NOT share with reviewers

2. blind_review_instructions.txt  
   - Give VERBATIM to reviewers
   - Prevents founder bias

3. reviewer_responses_template.json
   - Each reviewer gets a copy
   - Standardized response format

4. Phase75_Execution_Status.json
   - Current execution state
   - Timestamped progress tracking

5. misalignment_analysis.ps1
   - Automated analysis of reviewer understanding
   - Run AFTER response collection

6. trust_delta_scoring.ps1
   - Calculates trust metrics
   - Determines Phase 75 PASS/FAIL

7. phase75_completion_report.ps1
   - Generates final report
   - Run AFTER analysis

🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION (Next 48-72 hours)
You must now:

1. OPEN reviewer_profiles.json
2. SELECT 3-5 REAL PEOPLE matching:
   • R1: Technical skeptic (engineer/data, skeptical of AI)
   • R2: Domain practitioner (fitness professional, real-world intuition)
   • R3: Critical non-technical thinker (asks why, challenges authority)

3. CONTACT them using ONLY this phrase:
   "I'm testing whether a system explains itself clearly.
   Would you review some materials independently?"

4. SCHEDULE distribution of:
   • Phase 74 External Review Packet
   • blind_review_instructions.txt  
   • reviewer_responses_template.json

⏱️ TIMELINE FROM NOW
• T+0-3 days: Reviewer selection
• T+3-4 days: Material distribution
• T+4-11 days: Independent review window (SILENCE PROTOCOL)
• T+11-12 days: Response collection
• T+12-13 days: Automated analysis
• T+13-14 days: Phase 75 verdict

Total: ~2 weeks

🧠 EPISTEMIC POSITION
Remember what you are measuring:

You are NOT testing if reviewers agree with you.
You ARE testing if they reach the SAME CONCLUSIONS independently.

You are NOT persuading.
You ARE measuring interpretability.

You are NOT improving the system.
You ARE validating external credibility.

Failure is NOT defeat.
Failure IS valuable data about explanation quality.
