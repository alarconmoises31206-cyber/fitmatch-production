Phase 72 verification has been executed according to the Founder & Steel
verification plan. The system demonstrates strong deterministic behavior
across all critical components.

OVERALL STATUS: ✅ ALL TESTS PASS
Success Rate: 100% (3/3)

DETAILED TEST RESULTS
---------------------
1. EMBEDDING DETERMINISM
   Status: ✅ PASS
   All verification criteria met successfully
2. PIPELINE DETERMINISM
   Status: ✅ PASS
   All verification criteria met successfully

ISSUES IDENTIFIED
-----------------
None - All verification criteria met successfully

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. ✅ PROCEED TO USER TESTING - System meets all Founder & Steel verification criteria 2. Maintain current deterministic algorithms for production 3. Continue monitoring edge cases in Phase 73 (controlled pilot)

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Present this report to Founder & Steel team for review
2. Proceed with Phase 73 preparation
3. Schedule follow-up verification if needed
