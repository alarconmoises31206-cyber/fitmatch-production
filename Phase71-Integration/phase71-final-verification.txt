📋 PHASE 71 VERIFICATION - FINAL SUMMARY
========================================

✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETED
-------------------------

1. EMBEDDINGS FLOW: ✅ PASS
   - Deterministic generation
   - Graceful handling of edge cases
   - Proper array structure

2. PIPELINE STRUCTURE: ✅ PASS  
   - All integration points defined
   - Logging for founder inspection
   - Seed data for testing

3. DETERMINISTIC BEHAVIOR: ✅ PASS
   - Same inputs → same outputs
   - No randomness in core logic

4. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION: ✅ PASS
   - Handles empty/missing data
   - No crashes on edge cases

⚠️ VERIFICATION LIMITATIONS
---------------------------

Phase 71 cannot be fully verified in isolation because:

1. ❌ Requires Phase 69 ranking engine
   - Hard filter execution
   - Weighted scoring
   - Cosine similarity computation

2. ❌ Requires Phase 70 explanation components
   - Human-readable explanations
   - Confidence display
   - Role-based visibility

🏗️ PHASE READINESS STATUS
-------------------------

Based on file system check:
- Phase 69: Files exist, needs build
- Phase 70: Files exist, needs React setup  
- Phase 71: Structurally complete, needs integration

🎯 VERDICT: YELLOW LIGHT
------------------------

Phase 71 is architecturally sound but requires:

PHASE 71.5 - INTEGRATED VERIFICATION
------------------------------------
1. Build and test Phase 69 ranking engine
2. Set up Phase 70 React components  
3. Run integrated tests with all three phases
4. Verify end-to-end deterministic behavior

📊 RECOMMENDATION
-----------------

PROCEED WITH INTEGRATED VERIFICATION (Phase 71.5)

The Phase 71 wiring is correct and demonstrates:
- Proper embedding flow ✓
- Deterministic behavior ✓  
- Graceful degradation ✓
- Complete pipeline structure ✓

Once Phases 69 & 70 are production-ready, Phase 71 will
connect them into a fully deterministic end-to-end system.
