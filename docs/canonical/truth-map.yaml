      usage_type: filter
      visible_to_other_party: yes
      stored_for_future: yes
      future_use_note: \"May later contribute to semantic similarity if a clear, explainable mapping between goal tags and trainer specializations is defined.\"
      risk_note: \"Users may assume goals are interpreted beyond exact category matching and that higher relevance implies better suitability.\"
      justification: \"Used to prevent obviously incompatible trainer-client pairings based on declared specialization tags.\"

      usage_type: none
      visible_to_other_party: conditional
      stored_for_future: yes
      future_use_note: \"Could be used to filter or warn against trainer intensity levels, but only after establishing a clear, rule-based mapping between level labels and trainer-provided metadata.\"
      risk_note: \"Users may assume their fitness level directly influences trainer selection or trainer preparedness.\"
      justification: \"Collected for trainer context and potential future compatibility features, but currently not part of matching logic.\"

      usage_type: none
      visible_to_other_party: conditional
      stored_for_future: yes
      future_use_note: \"Could enable matching on trainer-advertised 'training style' tags if a clear, closed taxonomy is defined and mapped.\"
      risk_note: \"Users may assume matching accounts for nuanced style preferences or trainer expertise in specific modalities, leading to unmet expectations.\"
      justification: \"Gathered to inform future feature development around style compatibility; currently not used in matching.\"
      origin_uncertain: no

      usage_type: none
      visible_to_other_party: conditional
      stored_for_future: yes
      future_use_note: \"Could be used to filter trainers based on their typical session frequency or availability, but only if a clear, rule-based requirement is defined.\"
      risk_note: \"Users may assume the system considers their availability in scheduling or trainer matching, potentially expecting automated calendar coordination.\"
      justification: \"Collected to understand client commitment level and for potential future scheduling features; currently not used in matching.\"

      stored_for_future: yes
      future_use_note: \"Could inform trainer pricing or availability filtering if session length is a defined, filterable attribute in trainer profiles.\"
      risk_note: \"Users may assume the system matches them with trainers who offer sessions of that exact length or can accommodate it within scheduling.\"
      justification: \"Collected to understand client expectations and for potential future pricing or scheduling features; currently not used in matching.\"
      origin_uncertain: no

      future_use_note: \"Stored for compliance, reporting, and potential future anonymized bias analysis; no planned use in matching beyond the existing explicit filter.\"
      risk_note: \"Users may assume the system applies nuanced or culturally-sensitive handling of gender preferences beyond a simple binary filter, or that preferences are not shared.\"
      justification: \"Explicitly requested by users for comfort/safety; implemented as a strict binary filter on trainer profile gender field.\"

      future_use_note: \"Could be used for demographic analytics or anonymized trend reporting; not planned for matching or filtering without explicit user consent and clear rules.\"
      risk_note: \"Users may assume age influences matching (e.g., similar age cohorts) or that trainers receive their exact age for compatibility assessment.\"

# EPISTEMIC INTEGRITY CHECK
# ? No field uses \"future AI\" as justification
# ? Every field has explicit used_now and usage_type
# ? Risk notes capture user inference hazards
# ? Future use is conditional and explainable
